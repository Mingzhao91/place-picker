It appears as shimmering ribbons or curtains of light that dance and flow across the night sky. Colors typically include green, red, yellow, purple, and white.\n\nThe phenomenon is caused by the collision of charged particles from the sun with atoms in Earth's atmosphere. These energetic particles excite the atmospheric gases, which then release light as they return to their original energy levels.\n\nThe Northern Lights are a captivating spectacle, and their beauty has inspired myths and legends for centuries. Seeing them in person is a bucket-list experience for many travelers."
